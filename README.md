# masters-SyntheticAssets
This is the repo for Tyler Danno's Master's final year project - DeFi Synthetic Assets: Systematization of Platforms and Data Insights.

The repo contains the following folders:

# Data
* This folder contains all of the GraphQL queries used to collect on-chain data, along with their results
* Data is stored as json files - max length that a single query could return was 1000 entries, this can be seen as there are multiple .json files for some pieces of data
* MATLAB files are what are used to collate the data and convert from .json file form into a form that can be manipulated easily and displayed in graphs
* Any data retrieved from non GraphQL sources is also stored in this folder

# Documents
* This folder contains the completed report and slides for the master's project

# Images
* Images used in the appendix of the report are stored in this folder

# Plots
* Each plot obtained from the MATLAB files is stored in this folder
